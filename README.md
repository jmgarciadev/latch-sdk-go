## Latch Golang SDK 

This is a **NOT** official SDK for Latch for the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language

* **Requirements**

    - You will need [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install). I am using version 1.8.3 on Ubuntu Linux
    - Read the official [Latch documentation](https://latch.elevenpaths.com/www/developers/doc_api)
    - In order to use this library, you will also need a [Latch account](https://latch.elevenpaths.com/), from there you will have access to your Application Id/User Id and the Secret values.
